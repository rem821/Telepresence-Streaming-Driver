# Robot Controller Relay Service Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust values as needed

# Network Configuration
network:
  # Ingest socket - receives commands from external controllers
  ingest:
    host: "0.0.0.0"        # Listen on all interfaces
    port: 32115            # UDP port for incoming commands

  # Servo driver configuration
  servo:
    ip: "192.168.1.150"    # IP address of the servo driver
    port: 502              # Port of the servo driver
    response_timeout: 1.0  # Timeout for servo responses (seconds)
    translator: "tg_drives"  # Servo translator type (tg_drives)

  # Robot controller configuration
  robot:
    ip: "10.0.31.11"       # IP address of the robot controller
    port: 5555             # Port of the robot controller
    response_timeout: 0.5  # Timeout for robot responses (seconds)

# TG Drives Servo Configuration
tg_drives:
  azimuth_min: -180000       # Minimum azimuth in motor units
  azimuth_max: 180000        # Maximum azimuth in motor units
  elevation_min: -90000      # Minimum elevation in motor units
  elevation_max: 90000       # Maximum elevation in motor units
  speed: 100000              # Servo speed
  speed_multiplier: 0.0      # Speed multiplier for accelerated movement
  filter_alpha: 0.15         # Low-pass filter (0-1, higher = less filtering)

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  level: "INFO"            # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  file: null               # Log file path, or null for stdout only
  # file: "/var/log/robot_relay.log"  # Example log file path

# Performance Configuration
performance:
  socket_buffer_size: 8192          # UDP socket buffer size (bytes)
  max_consecutive_errors: 3          # Max errors before service restart
  socket_error_backoff: 5.0          # Backoff time after socket errors (seconds)
